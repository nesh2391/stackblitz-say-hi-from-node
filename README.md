# About Me:

This server is a starter server written in node js using express framework. It exposes two endpoints, one returns a HTML and the other returns a simple rest message that says Hi.

NO Database connection
NO Security connection

Unsecure simple server

#### Why?

The server was created for test deployments with Chef Software. IT is in a public repo.

#### How to use?

If you need a simple server to test some CI/CD processes, then fell free to pull this server down. The GitLink is made public and should be accessable to all.

#### Operation

    npm install && npm start

to simply run:
npm start
